		<h1 class="title">education during the pandemic</h1>
		<p class="content" style="top:-5px">The global disruption to education caused by the COVD-19 pandemic is unprecedented, with serious learning consequences. More than 1.6 billion students were affected by school closures as a result of the crisis, which brought education systems around the world to a halt. While nearly every country in the world provided students with remote learning opportunities, the quality and scope of these programs varied greatly, and they were only partial substitutes for in-person learning. Schools are still closed for millions of children and youth nearly two years later, and millions more are at risk of never returning to school. Evidence of the negative effects of school closures on children's learning reveals a harrowing reality: Learning losses are substantial, with the most marginalized children and youth disproportionately affected.
			<br><br><br>Evidence from countries like Brazil, Pakistan, India, South Africa, and Mexico shows significant declines in math and reading skills, which are sometimes roughly proportional to the length of school closures. There was variation across countries, as well as by subject, socioeconomic status, gender, and grade level of students regarding how students were affected by the pandemic. For example, younger students, particularly pre-schoolers, had less access to remote learning and were more affected by learning loss than their older counterparts. Evidence from around the world suggests that the pandemic has exacerbated educational inequities, with low-income children, people with disabilities, and girls being less likely to access remote learning.

Gender was a driver of inequality in some countries.</b> Girls often have restricted access to devices and the internet, as well as a lack of ICT or information and communications technologies knowledge and skills, limiting their capability to benefit from remote learning. In some countries and communities, social norms may create inequalities for girls to use digital devices. Gendered demands on girls' time, such as increased responsibilities at home, also obstruct their ability to engage in remote learning and result in less time for schoolwork.
				<br><br>However, emerging research from Ethiopia, India, and Vietnam shows that there are no substantial variations in the distant learning experiences of boys and girls, and that uneven remote learning experiences are more likely to be driven by the household's socioeconomic level. In Peru, male students were less likely to participate in distant learning than female students.

Digital divides between urban and rural communities were greatest in Eastern and Southern Africa, East Asia and the Pacific, and Latin America and the Caribbean.

In ten European countries, fourth grade students from low socioeconomic backgrounds were half as likely as their more affluent peers to have internet access at home.

						<h2>Younger students: Most affected by pandemic-induced learning loss</h2>
						<p>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Year One to Three students are facing difficulty in mastering the three Rs (reading, writing and arithmetic) due to the pandemic's disruption in their schooling. According to experts, If no intervention measures are implemented, these students' failure to master the three basic learning tools will affect their learning process at a higher level, causing them to fall behind.</p>

						<h2>1/3 of Ugandan students may not return after world's longest lockdown</h2>
						<p>KAYUNGA, Uganda -- As Uganda's schools reopen after nearly two years, ending the world's longest lockdown, Ugandan officials expect that a third of children who were in school when the pandemic began will not return. This projection was based on the widespread incidence of children especially during the pandemic having to work to help their families make ends meet, as well as teenage pregnancies and marriage.</p>

						<h2>With more girls pregnant, Zimbabwe pushes for return to school</h2>
						<p>HARARE, Zimbabwe -- Amid the pandemic, Zimbabwe reported a dramatic increase in pregnancies among girls and teenagers. In Zimbabwe, nearly a third of girls marry before they reach the age of 18, and 4% before they reach the age of 15, depriving them of an education, increasing the risk of sexual violence, and putting them at risk of death or serious injury during childbirth. The spread of the coronavirus exacerbated the problem. After rising numbers, the government changed a law that had previously barred pregnant students from attending school in August 2020.</p>

						<h2>Digital Braille opens up world of learning for visually challenged</h2>
						<p>NEW DELHI, India -- Team BlisCare, from Rashtrasant Tukadoji Maharaj Nagpur University, India, has won the 2021 Ericsson Innovation Awards competition for developing a solution that provides equal educational opportunities for visually impaired people all over the world. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the duo realized that the transition to online education was a significant disadvantage for visually impaired students. Chinmaya Naik and Nikita Kumari used their engineering skills to create "BlisCare," an innovation that digitizes Braille. The cost-effective solution uses a tablet to create digital braille from any text or graphic, both online and offline, in real time via a touch-based system, as opposed to the current method of converting text to Braille and then printing it with a Braille printer, which has a high cost of printing and resources.</p>

						<h2>Kids' behavior worsened with remote learning</h2>
						<p>Remote learning has posed a challenge for children's behavioral health, according to Harvard University researchers. The stress and disruption caused by the pandemic has caused children to act out.  Parents have cited a number of "maladaptive" behaviors, including aggression or withdrawal, and the frequency of "dysregulated" behaviors, such as a limited attention span or difficulty switching between tasks.</p>

						<h2>COVID-19: Students face $17 trillion loss in lifetime earnings</h2>
						<p>According to a UN-backed report, school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic could cost today's students $17 trillion in lost lifetime earnings. Furthermore, the report indicates that the proportion of children living in "learning poverty" in low- and middle-income countries could rise from 53% to 70%. The report reveals that real data is now correlating with simulations estimating significant learning losses as a result of school closures.</p>
