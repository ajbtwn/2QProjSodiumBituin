Or is it Arithmetic? For the longest time, the world has suffered – yes, suffered – with the understanding of what education means. There is so much attention attached to the literacy component in education, to the extent that people think of education itself as all about making more and more people literate. While that does serve a greater purpose and centers around building economy-worthy people who have the ability to add to the world’s monetary capacity, it stops short of adding to the empathy that this world could gain a lot from having. By emphasising on the idea of economically empowering people to take on better jobs and augment the productivity of the economy, we have not invested much in education for the greater interests of peace. A social climate of peace can thrive only if there is a communal approach to it through education, but not just literacy-driven education – rather, peace education.<span class="quote">"</span></p>

In primary school, 76 percent of children attend, but this figure drops to 28 percent in secondary school.
								<br><br>Here, students in Sudan try to get the attention of their teacher to answer a question. Because their classroom collapsed in a recent storm, the girls are sitting outside in the scorching heat.

			<h1 class="title">get involved</h1>
			<p class="content" style="top:-5px">This past decade, more children are in school at all levels of education than ever before, and they are staying in school longer. This is also true in low-income countries and in Sub-Saharan Africa. Despite a 50% increase in the number of school-aged children since 2000, the global number of out-of-school children has decreased by 30%. For girls, these advancements in educational access have been even more rapid. However, a quarter of a billion children, equally divided between boys and girls, are still out of school.
				<br><br>The right to education is a notion that many people take for granted. Despite this, millions of children around the world are still denied this basic right. Simple actions taken in people's daily lives and at work can have a significant impact on ordinary citizens, local communities, and the world at large. Use your voice to help realize the right to education, such as through social media, a powerful tool today for enlightening people about current issues in society and amplifying  the importance of realizing fundamental human rights. Individuals who are aware of their rights are better equipped to assert them. Furthermore, be an active citizen by monitoring the implementation of the right to education and reporting deprivations and violations. Advocate and campaign for the full implementation of the right to education for a brighter future for the world. As Nelson Mandela once said:
