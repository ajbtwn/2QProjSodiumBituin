		<h1 class="title">education in the philippines</h1>
		<p class="content" style="top:-5px">In the Philippines, private schools are more accessible to Filipinos from wealthy families or those who live in cities and developed towns. Less advantaged groups, on the other hand, are more likely to face a lack of classrooms, teachers, and other resources to maintain high-quality learning.
			<br><br>In a study conducted in 2018, out of 79 nations, a sample of 15-year-old Filipino school children ranked last in reading comprehension, while in science and math, they ranked 78th. A key insight from this study is that the people that were examined were largely from public schools. Therefore, the crisis also lies in the fact that many Filipinos are unable to read or perform basic math calculations.
			<br><br>It is undeniable that there is a class split in the country between affluent and poor kids. Despite this, less developed countries may focus on learning if it is one of their top priorities. In comparison to its neighbors, the Philippines, however, does not invest in high-quality education. Despite the digital age, many public schools still lack computers and other equipment. Furthermore, because public school instructors are among the lowest-paid state employees, a shortage of teachers is one of the country's most pressing challenges.
			<br><br>As in many other developing countries, 'brain drain,' or the departure of talented students, graduates, and teachers to other countries, is a major issue in the Philippine education system. According to a World Economic Forum survey conducted in 2019, the Philippines had the lowest percentage of youth among six ASEAN members saying they would like to stay in the country to work, with more than half of Filipino youth wanting to go abroad to land jobs. This appears to be a problem that will persist until the opportunities at home equal the number of skilled graduates coming out of the education system.
			<br><br>Despite these problems, the Philippines' education system is regarded as one of the most developed in Asia, with rates of basic education completion, higher education participation, and adult literacy comparable to those of far more developed economies such as Hong Kong, Singapore, and South Korea.

			<h1 class="title" style="font-size:30px;">bangsamoro autonomous region in muslim mindanao (barmm)</h1>
			<p class="content2">Government policy tends to favor schools in Manila, with student performance in areas farthest from the capital, such as Mindanao, being lower. Bangsamoro's poor educational situation reflects a long history of government funding neglect, ineffective institutional arrangements and coordination, a lack of accountability and transparency of public funds, and absence of reliable data. In 2015, it was revealed that many villages had no schools, that "ghost teachers" existed, that unqualified teachers were chosen, and that salaries were not paid. The Department of Education in Bangsamoro is reported to be the most corrupt regional agency in the autonomous region.
				<br><br>Children in Bangsamoro do not have access to any schooling facilities in at least 213 barangays. Over 45,000 pupils in elementary school are affected by this issue. There is a pressing need to build or rebuild schools and learning institutions in Mindanao that have been destroyed by war or have been abandoned due to neglect or a lack of resources. The quality of basic education in Bangsamoro remains far below the national average, and the cost of producing a high school graduate in the region is more expensive than anywhere else in the country. This shows the importance of investing in improving the quality of learning and teaching in schools in Bangsamoro, as well as addressing the governance issues that have plagued Mindanao's educational infrastructure.

			<h1 class="title">indigenous peoples (ip<span style="text-transform: lowercase;font-size:20px;">s</span>)</h1>
			<p class="content2">Through the educational system, the concept of colonial mentality is strategically implanted in the Filipino psyche, creating ubiquitous national consciousness and identity while unconsciously disfavoring and neglecting the Indigenous Peoples' (IPs') diverse cultural orientations. The Philippines is one of the first Asian countries to pass legislation recognizing the specific needs of its IPs. The Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act was signed into law in 1997 to ensure that the IPs have access to essential health and education services, such as academic programs that incorporate Indigenous knowledge, practices, and culture. Even after two decades, however, much has remained wanting in terms of implementation.
				<br><br>There remains a lack of educators fluent in the language of the IPs, as the majority of Mother Tongueâ€“based curricula only cover local dialects and languages, and not the language of the IPs itself. Another problem is that the bulk of courses taught in educational institutions need the usage of English terms that have no ethnic equivalent. Poverty, the lack of awareness of the IPs on their rights to education, the government's failure to enforce existing policies on IP Education, and the lack of agents of change all help reinforce the chains that keep the IPs marginalized, inferior, and victims of oppression and domination.

			<h1 class="title" style="margin-bottom:15px;">pandemic: digital divide in learning</h1>
			<p class="content" style="font-size: 15px;">In 2018, the number of students enrolled in the Philippines reached an all-time high of 27.7 million. However, the numbers decreased minimally in 2019 with 27.7 million enrollees, and plunged in 2020, owing to the pandemic and the digital divide.
				<br><br>Due to COVID-19 closures, 89 percent of the world's student population, or 1.52 billion children and youth, are out of school. According to the Department of Education, nearly 4 million students in the Philippines were unable to enroll for the school year 2020. As a result, the number of out-of-school youth (OSY) continues to rise, posing a serious problem that must be addressed to avoid worse consequences in the long term.
				<br><br>Internet access was a huge challenge for schools as they transitioned to remote learning. According to government statistics, only about 18 percent of Filipino households have access to the internet at home, and internet access is even more limited in rural areas. Moreover, it is not cheap: according to a study by cybersecurity firm SurfShark, the internet in the Philippines is among the least stable and slowest, yet also the most expensive, out of 79 countries surveyed.
