			<p class="content">Increasing educational access can help a society's overall health and longevity, as well as grow economies and combat climate change. Numerous factors, however, can limit children's access to education in many developing countries.</p><br>
			<p class="content">Language barriers, gender roles, and the use of child labor can all stymie efforts to provide high-quality education. The world's most vulnerable children, those from low-income families, are more likely to miss school. This includes young girls as well as disabled children.</p>

			<p class="content">In the Philippines, private schools are more accessible to Filipinos from wealthy families or those who live in cities and developed towns. Less advantaged groups, on the other hand, are more likely to face a lack of classrooms, teachers, and other resources to maintain high-quality learning.</p>
			<br><p class="content">In comparison to its neighbors, the Philippines does not invest in high-quality education. Despite the digital age, many public schools lack computers and other tools. Furthermore, because teachers are among the lowest-paid state employees, a shortage of public school teachers is one of the country's most pressing issues.</p>

In primary school, 76 percent of children attend, but this figure drops to 28 percent in secondary school.
								<br><br>Here, students in Sudan try to get the attention of the teacher to answer a question. Because their classroom collapsed in a recent storm, the girls are sitting outside in the scorching heat.
