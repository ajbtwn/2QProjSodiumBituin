		<p class="content" style="top:-5px">Increasing access to education can improve the overall health and longevity of a society, grow economies, and even combat climate change. Yet in many developing countries, children’s access to education can be limited by numerous factors.</p>
		<br><p class="content">According to United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) data released in 2018, about 258 million children and youth are out of school around the world (see table below). The data highlights the gap between the world’s richest and poorest countries: In low-income countries, 32.4% of all youth of primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary age are not in school compared to just 3.5% in high-income countries. A GPIA of 1.07 in the world also shows that girls face the greatest barriers to receiving education.</p>

			<p class="content2">Lack of access to education is a significant predictor of passing poverty from generation to generation, and receiving an education is one of the most effective ways to achieve financial stability.</p><br>
			<p class="content2">Poverty-stricken families frequently must choose between sending their children to school and meeting other basic needs. Even if families are not required to pay tuition, there are additional costs such as uniforms, books, supplies, and/or exam fees.</p>

			<h1 class="title">gender discrimination</h1>
			<p class="content2">Although keeping girls in school benefits them and their families, many families have to choose which of their children to send to school due to poverty. Girls frequently miss out because it is assumed that educating a girl is less valuable than educating a boy. Instead, they are forced to marry, work, or stay at home and do household chores.</p>
			<br><p class="content2">Girls also miss days of school each year or are too embarrassed to participate in class because they lack access to menstrual hygiene management, or their schools do not provide appropriate toilet facilities.</p>

		<h1 class="title">other barriers to education</h1>
		<ol class="content2" style="width:95%;">
			<li><h3>Having no teacher, or having an untrained teacher</h3>There is an insufficient number of teachers to achieve universal primary or secondary education, and many of the teachers who are currently employed are inexperienced. The most important predictor of student learning has been discovered to be teacher effectiveness.</li>
			<li><h3>No classroom</h3>Without the proper environment, a child cannot learn. In many countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, children are crammed into overcrowded classrooms, crumbling classrooms, or learning outside. The issue isn't just a lack of classrooms: It's also a lack of all the basic amenities that a school should have, such as running water and toilets.</li>
			<li><h3>The exclusion of children with disabilities</h3>Despite the fact that education is a basic human right, the world's 93 to 150 million disabled children are commonly denied access to school. Up to 95 percent of children with disabilities are out of school in some of the world's poorest countries. This group is particularly vulnerable to denial of their right to education due to prejudice, a lack of inclusive teaching methods training among teachers, and a lack of accessible schools.</li>
			<li><h3>Living in a country in conflict or at risk of conflict</h3>Children exposed to violence are more likely to fall behind in school and drop out. Almost 250 million children live in conflict-torn countries. In 35 crisis-affected countries, more than 75 million children and young people aged 3 to 18 are in urgent need of educational support, with young girls 90 percent more likely to drop out of secondary school in conflict zones than elsewhere.</li>
			<li><h3>Distance from home to school</h3>A three-hour walk to school in each direction is not uncommon for many children around the world. For many children, especially those with disabilities, are malnourished or ill, or are obliged to help around the house, this is simply too much. On their long and dangerous walks to and from school, many children, particularly girls, are also vulnerable to violence.</li>
